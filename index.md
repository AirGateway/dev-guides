AirGateway NDC Platform Developer Guide
====================

This is a developer guide intended to provide insights on a technical integration with AirGateway's **NDC JSON API** aggregation service.

Our platform is designed to facilitate the interaction with the new distribution model brought by [NDC (New Distribution Capability)](https://www.iata.org/en/programs/airline-distribution/ndc/) established by IATA and adopted by a growing number of the most relevant airlines in the World.

Our **NDC Aggregation Platform** facilitates the interaction with multiple NDC providers in a single one-to-one implementation insteadd of handling multiple NDC implementations. This facilitates aggregated shopping, booking, and servicing of multiple NDC providers/airlines.


Also transitioning among different NDC versions/implementations will be a  much easier process to handle relying on our **NDC Aggregation Platform**.

To try our **NDC JSON API** you need to register in our [Sandbox Agency Portal](https://agency.bookingpad.net/).
